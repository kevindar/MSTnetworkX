# MSTnetworkX
This project is for the use of learning Kruskal and Prim Algorithm using the library NetworkX in Python.
The project is just a simple task made such a fuss by a Professor in Computer Engineering.
Just hoping that others may be able to also learn easily using the source code for Jupyter Python notebook in this repo, more detailed explanations in the notebook.
